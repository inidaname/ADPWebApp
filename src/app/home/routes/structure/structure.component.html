            <h4>The National Chairman</h4>
            <p>
              The role of the Party's National Chairman is often different from a party leader. The
              duties of the chairman/chairperson are typically concerned with the party membership as
              a whole and the activities of the party organization. Chairman often play important roles
              in strategies to recruit and retain members in campaign fundersing and in internal party governance,
              where they may serve as member of or preside over a governing board or council.
